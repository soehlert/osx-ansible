# Ansible
Ansible configurations, playbooks and roles for setting up an OSX host.

osx-ansible/playbooks/common.yml shows what roles will be loaded.\
To see what any role does, look at osx-ansible/roles/${role}/task/main.yml

## Before Running You Should:
    cd osx-ansible
    cp example.yml local.yml

Or you can just create your own local.yml file with just the variables you'd like to override over varaibles from defaults.yml.\
You'll want to do this, as some defaults variables have my info in them.

## Installation

    sudo /bin/zsh # not sure why, but we need to sudo once before the install-homebrew script works
    exit
    ./roles/homebrew/files/install-homebrew.sh # homebrew will not install if its run as root
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)" # by default after installing homebrew it will not be part of your path

#### Makefile:
    make bootstrap
    make install
